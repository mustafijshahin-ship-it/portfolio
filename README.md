## 🔧 Development & Optimization Highlights

### **Image Optimization Strategy**
```html
<!-- Optimized WebP images with explicit dimensions -->
<picture>
    <source srcset="Images/beach.webp" type="image/webp">
    <img src="Images/beach.jpg" alt="Kuakata Sea Beach"
         width="300" height="168" loading="lazy" decoding="async">
</picture>
Performance Optimization Process
CSS Consolidation: Merged style.css into main.css to eliminate render-blocking requests and remove unused CSS.

Image Optimization: Converted all images to optimized WebP and JPEG formats, significantly reducing file size.

Accessibility Enhancement: Added explicit width and height attributes to all images to eliminate layout shifts.

Code Cleanup: Removed unused files and streamlined the project structure.
